# L2F_Challenge_YashGadhia

Please refer to the report for all details regarding implementation and approach.  
To run code, please use one of the provided ipynb files. We have provided one each for PID (baseline) and Policy Search, and two files to train and test PPO.  
Our final submission is policy search and it's result, which is a **reward of 1729.61** from a **run-time of 468.67s** (3 checkpoints).  
Some of our other policies run for much longer, going up to **~620s**, and can be used if runtime is the main requirement.
